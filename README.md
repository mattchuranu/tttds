# Time Travelly Top-Down Shooter

A prototype for a top-down shooter involving a time travel mechanic where, each time you traveled back in time, you cloned yourself and your clone continued to fight alongside you in a manner similar to that of Cannon Fodder. I made this circa 2012 and am releasing it into the public domain.

You can play a compiled version of the game [here](https://mattchuranu.itch.io/time-travelly-top-down-shooter).
